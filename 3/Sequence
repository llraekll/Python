Sequence
    Strings are sequences, 
	Can index sequence
    a='rakshith', 	a[0]/[-8] = r		a[1]/[-7] = a		a[2]/[-6] = k	
	can slice sequence
	a[1:5] This gives the letters from the index a[1] to a[4], the number previous to the mentioned number on right will not be considered,
	a[1:5] gives us aksh
	a[0:1] gives us r
	a[0:-6] gives us ra
	a[:4] gives us raks, when no number is mentioned on LHS it is considered from the start of the sequence
	a[4:] gives us hith, when no number is mentioned on RHS it is considered to the end of the sequence
    
    Iterate - Can be repeated over and over, like a loop.
        for letter in a:
            print(letter)
        print('done')
        
        output:
        r
        a
        k
        s
        h
        i	
        t
        h
        done
