#Data types

-Integers - numbers from negative infinity to zero to infinity.
-Float - Same as Integers but in decimals, basically decimals.
-Boolean/ Bool - It says true or false.
-String - A sequence of characters written in single or double quotes, which can be alphabets or numbers.
    -example - "hello", each letter has individual memory allocated
-None type - This takes on only one value that is none which is zero 


#Operators

##Numerical Operation - 
    -Addition +
    -Subtraction - 
    -Multiplication * 
    -Division / 
        -% Gives us the remainder, 17 % 3 = 2, used in finding prime numbers
        -// Shows us how many times the denominator can divide the numerator, 6//2= 3, 7//2= 3
    -Exponent ** (To the power of) 

    Works on PEMDAS
    P- Parenthesis
    E- Exponent
    M- Multiplication
    D- Division
    A- Addition
    S- Subtraction
    
##String Operation -
    -No mathematical operations can be performed on strings
    -Two exceptions are made:
        -String Concatenation- Addition of strings, example- 'a'+'av'= 'aav', 'a '+'av'= 'a av', '7'+'8'= '78'
        -String "Multiplication"- Not exactly multiplication but adding the string over and over the number of times mentioned with a star
            -example- 'rak' * 3 = 'rakrakrak', basically rak+rak+rak

##Boolean Operation -
    -This operator says if the math or comparison done is true or false similar to correct or wrong
        example- Comparison of strings, integers, float, data types. ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=
    -Gates- AND gate, OR gate, Not gate
    -AND gate- Both the sides must be true for true else the output is false
    -OR gate- Both the sides must be false for false else the output is true, opposite of AND
    -NOT gate- not True= False, not False = True
