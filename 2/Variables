Variables 
    Something that has no fixed value and can be assigned with a constant, Variables can't be repeated but be reused.
    x = 2   y = 'abc'
    Here = is assigning the value to the variables x and y, values on the RHS are assigned to LHS
    Using x == y results in an output False as == is an operator, but in x=y the value of y is assigned to x
    x=y     x will be 'abc'
	Variable names can consist of numbers but not special characters and also cannot start with number, variables are CASE SENSETIVE.
